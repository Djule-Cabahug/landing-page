                <p class="quote-text">I had a tough breakup and the house never looked so lonely before. Then I decided I wanted to buy an aquarium and some pet fish to keep myself company. Aquapets just had everything I needed for that at a reasonable price and with great customer service. The waiting time was minimal too. Overall, I had a great experience with them and would highly recommend buying from them!</p>
