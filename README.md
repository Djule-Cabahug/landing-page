This project is aimed at creating a landing page using Flexbox, which is the main focus of this activity. At the end of this project, the developer will have demonstrated his ability to control the alignment and distribution of items, to control whether items should grow or shrink, to distribute extra space within or around the items, to use margins for split navigation if necessary, to wrap items, and to control the initial size using flex-basis.
